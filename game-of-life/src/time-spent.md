- 00:00 - 01:45 - general AI research, Angular documentation, local setup and initial page
- 01:45 - 03:00 - main logic done
- 03:00 - 04:00 - I've fiddled a lot with HTML/CSS
- 04:00 - 04:30 - refactor game logic in a separate service
- The rest I cannot really say specifically because most of the work was done during several small
  "sessions" in a hospital environment but I can maybe put focussed work somewhere around 8 and 12 hours
- Sadly, I've been able to include just one test on the main logic
